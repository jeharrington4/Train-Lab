In this file the variables and commands used will be listed and explained.


a=arduino_sim(): connects to arduino simulator file to run train process w/o a arduino or track

a=arduino('COM#'): connects to physical arduino, # is the port the arduino is connected to the computer with

a.servoAttach(1): connects the arduino to the servo located in the gate

a.servoWrite(x,Y): moves the servo motor which the arm of the gate is attached to. 
                        x is the servo number
                        Y is the angle that the servo will rotate to 

rLED = 14; : 
lLED = 15; : 
a.pinMode(rLED,'output'): 
a.pinMode(lLED,'output'): 

a.motorRun(1,'forward'): sets which way the train will move when powered (forward or backward)
a.motorSpeed(1,X): the X value determines speed with a range of 0-255
